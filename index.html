## Welcome :beers:

I'm a software engineer interested in the web, machine learning, and how both impact us. This is my homepage, feel free
to poke around.

Most excited about time series data for environmental and social impact.

Recently I've been working mostly in Python on topics ranging from ETL automation to mortgage returns to Computer
Vision.

This site is forked from the [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) template; An easy to use blogging platform
with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
