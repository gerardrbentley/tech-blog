    "*note:* These are recommendations, not hard and fast rules.\n",
    "There are trade-offs in every decision in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "While your set up is largely up to personal preference, some factors to consider are: \n",
    "- How many different computers you use (will your configuration transfer easily?)\n",
    "- How many different OS's you use (will your configuration work between Windows / Linux?)\n",
    "- How many projects or versions of python / python packages do you need to use\n",
    "- How invested are you in learning the command line (would GUI make your life much less stressful?)\n",

    "- Use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), the little sibling of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).\n",
    "It manages downloading and using different python versions and has some unique \"virtual environment\" features that are especially nice in data science work.\n",
    "    - For the most up to date information (i.e. if the following doesn't work), see the [official guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and click the link for your OS\n",
    "    - Browser / GUI method:\n",
    "        - Download the installer for Python 3.9 for your computer's OS (or 3.10 if available).\n",
    "            - *note* most Windows computers are 64-bit these days, if you're unsure just [double check](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/determine-whether-your-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64-bit-version-of-the-windows-operating-system-aac162a1-0cb3-46f2-888f-2f22897396ce#:~:text=System%20Information%20window-,Click%20Start%2C%20type%20system%20in%20the%20search%20box%2C%20and%20then,the%20System%20Type%20under%20Item.)\n",

    "- Text Editing and Searching [Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics) including stuff like using multiple cursors, search and replace over multiple files, auto save (which is included in my `json` settings above)\n",
    "- Make a new virtual environment for your project with `python -m venv venv` or look into using `conda` to manage your environments\n",

    "- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you're going to be doing some web development or otherwise need `npm`\n",
    "- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) if you want to explore modern container based deployment\n",
