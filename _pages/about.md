I'm a software developer interested in web-based apps, ethical / explainable AI, and bringing coding to others.

I started programming at [Hotchkiss](https://www.hotchkiss.org/), back in 2013.
I took the one and only Java class then left off until college.

I graduated from [Pomona College](https://www.pomona.edu/) in 2019 with a BA in Computer Science, then stuck around for the summer and fall as part of a post-bacc research year.
Working with professor Joe Osborn we authored ["The Videogame Affordances Corpus"](http://www.exag.org/archive/bentley2019affordances.pdf) at EXAG 2019, which was the first paper for our 'Formal Analysis of Interactive Media (FAIM) Lab'.
My work over that year focused mainly on testing Pytorch models to analyze in-game screenshots from a collection of classic action and adventure games.

Through the pandemic I took a contract role for an Edu-tech startup [Edlyft](https://www.edlyft.com/) (started by some fellow Hotchkiss [alums](https://www.edlyft.com/ourstory)!)

In January of 2021 I started a job with [Cascade Financial Services](https://www.cascadeloans.com/) doing Python automation and working on some legacy projects.

The only machine learning I work on there focuses on mortgage returns and already has established models and usecases.
So I started part-time teaching AI and Python topics with [AI Camp](https://www.ai-camp.org/) to get back to education and ML.
