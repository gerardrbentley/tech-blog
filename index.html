I'm a software engineer interested in the web, machine learning, and how both impact us. This is my homepage, feel free
to poke around.

Recentley I've been working mostly in Python on topics ranging from ETL automation to mortgage returns to Computer
Vision

This site is forked from the [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) template; An easy to use blogging platform
with extra features for Jupyter Notebooks.
